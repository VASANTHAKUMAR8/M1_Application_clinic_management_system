Introduction

The project clinic management is a software developed to simplify the communication process between the doctor and the receptionist. The software would be operated by two admins one is doctor and the other is receptionist. Receptionist would be responsible for assigning patient ID to the patient visiting the clinic and save it in the database along with their details. These token numbers along with respective patient details are sent to doctor.
One of the most vital institution that need a computerized recording are Clinics.The patient will be ask by the dental aide and done just by recording the patient's name, age, birthday and gender. And when it through, the treatment which is done for the patient will also be listed to his/her summary of information with his/her last treatment to the clinic, to be able to identify the last treatment.In this system, where everything needs to do be done efficiently and effectively the existences of Clinic Management System(CMS) become neccessary. The used of CMS can enhance the services and also the work flow of all activity that happends in hospitals where it helps in reducing the workload of medical staff, the number of man power needed and it also make hospitals management become more manageable and easier to control.

Research

Nowadays, most of the Businesses and Institutions are still using an old system of recording, which is done manually. The stuff/assistant are still experiencing an old tradition of recording, where it consumes more space, time, paper and other problem redundancy to find/store the patient's information.
Nowadays, the current Clinic Management System that are available had not been widely used. This is because the process of task that occurred in hospitals is quite complex compared to other organizatiopn. The other reson is that , mostof existing system does not full fill the requirements of doctor and other medical staff in our country.Manual Recording System, even in today's world can still provide an effective and useful way to record and deliver an efficient information system. But it lacks the ability to auto-sort the records. Employees will have to do it manually and takes time to properly arrange the records. Another concern is the issue of quality of the paper record. There are limitations to the quality of the paper record. Paper is fragile and does not last permanently. Normal use of the record may result in torn or stained documents. Also, over the years, ink used to complete documentation can easily fade which result in information?s being erased. Staff hired to assemble, file, retrieve, or distribute the hard copy is a costly expense.The Clinic Management System (CMS) is designed and developed to guarantee the removal of various problem or to eliminate the problem of redundant that was increase the inefficiencies in data to be retrieve. These keeping of records were caused by the data, under the manual recording system was entered into books and paper files and was later stored in overcrowded storage rooms that may be made the retrieval of records close to impossible due to the manual system.

Features and Cost and Timeline

         The features of this system, the user can perform the CRUD operations to it. Like, add patient details by entering his/her name, phone number, patient ID,time reservasion. The user can also view all the available patient records. Such as details and search a patient by its name, age, time reservasion. Besides, the user can edit information as well as remove a patient’s whole date or only his/her name, phone number,time reservasion.This system will also ensures the preservation of personal records and ensure the accessibility only by the authorized personnel.To have a good and efficient records management system should be able to incorporate specific aspects of the systems mentioned above in order to provide and efficient means of records storage and management.
         
Reduce cost:
Reducing operational cost: Our project aim is to come up with a software product that will reduce the operational costs of a business.There will be no use of purchasing stationary and hence reduced operational costs.
Reducing errors:
our software will provide proper validation techniques thet will collectvely reduce errors done when recording data.

         
Defining Our System
         
         The Clinic Management System is divided into two, where the admin and user can be login separately. The Admin is the one that can add, delete and change about the user's information and also about the patient's information. The user, unlike admin is only responsible for keeping/recording about the patient's information. The Clinic Management System can view the master list of all the patient's details. The computerized system is not only responsible for recording the details about the patient, it also provide an information about the hired stuff/assistant. Having a computer system nowadays is very important including those small businesses to help them and make their business more competitive.The Clinic Management System (CMS) will help the clinic to keep and managed the personal records of the patient. Recording patient information is one of the important aspect of dental institution. There are Dental Clinic that records manually that's why it is very time consuming and more paper works. Clinic Management System is design to help the employee in recording the patient's record and will change the manual record into computerized records.This system will also ensures the preservation of personal records and ensure the accessibility only by the authorized personnel. To have a good and efficient records management system should be able to incorporate specific aspects of the systems mentioned above in order to provide and efficient means of records storage and management.
         
Project Goals and Objectives
         
Objective:

The general objective is to design and develop a Clinic Management System (CMS) for Dental Clinic to improve and make the system from manual to computerized that would enable the clinic for faster and more efficient storage, retrieval and updating of the clinic's record.To carry out the system problem for the possibility of developing a Clinic Management System for improving and modernization of the system.To design and develop a Clinic Management System for the dental clinic.To test and validate the Clinic Management System.To implement the Clinic Management System.

Project Scope

Clinic Management System was primarily developed to improve the clinic's system for storing data or information about the patient.

The system also deal with searching capability procedure of recorded patient which helps the user for easy retrieval of the records.

Project detail

In Admin mode

The system asks for password,the defauld password is 1234.The system allows 3 trails for the passwords entry,if the entered password was incorrect for consecutive times,the system shall close,After login in the admin mode,the system shall provied the following features:

1.Add nwe patient recode:
To add a new patient ,the user shall admin shall enter these basic information: name, age, gender and ID. The ID shall be unique for the user,if the entered ID is already exists, the system shall reject the entry.

2.Edit patient recode
By entering patient ID the system shall checks if the ID exists,the system shall alow the user to edit the patient information. If not,the system shall display incorrect ID message.

3.Reserve a slot with the doctor:
By default there are 5 available slots,2pm to 2.30pm,3pm to 3.30pm, 4pm to 4.30pm and 4.30pm to 5pm.Upon opening of this window, the system shall display the available slots. The admin shall enter the patient ID and the desired slot. The reserved slot shall not appear again in the next patient reservation.
